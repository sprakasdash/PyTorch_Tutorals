# PyTorch_Tutorials
Tutorials for PyTorch users from beginner to intermediate.

This list contains all my experiments and course assignments in understanding Deep Learning.  
The list will go on as:  
  1_PyTorch_Hacks contains essential introduction to PyTorch.  
  2_LeNet-5_MNISTNet_on_MNIST contains MNIST trained using LeNet & MNISTNet.  
  3_Training_FashionMNIST contains trained FasionMNIST dataset using custom made CNN.  
  4_cifar10_training contains CIFAR10 dataset trained on your custom made CNN.  
  5_cifar10_using_resnet contains CIFAR10 dataset trained using pretrained ResNet.  

Added Bi-LSTM tutorial for POS & NER.

  6_NLP_POS_Tagger contains code for POS tagging using Bi-LSTM using pretrained Glove word-embedding and custom function for     editing files
